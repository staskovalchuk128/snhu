How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on the project helped me develop a number of new design skills, such as improving time management and organization skills, as well as developing creativity and the ability to solve complex problems. In addition, I improved my skills of working with light in 3D space.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
I tried to create all my C++ classes and functions this way, so I could reuse them in the final project.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This tactic will help me in the future by reusing my code and this way it will be less work for me and more organized code.
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used OOP C++ programming to create my final project.
How did iteration factor into your development?
It saved my time to create the final project and also it minimized the change of making an errors.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
From the beginning of my final project, I was thinking about creating my classes this way, so at the end I can just put my code together and finish my project quickly.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
For my educational pathway this knowledge can help me with solving some problems with math, for example Calculus courses.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
For my professional pathway this knowledge can help me to get some job for example in video game industry where I could develop computer graphics.
